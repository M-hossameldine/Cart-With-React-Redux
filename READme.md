## About <a name = "about"></a>

This demo aims to practice on implementing side effects and asyncronous actions (e.g fetching data from backend servers)

There are Two Approaches to execute side-effects and async tasks when dispatching actions with redux/redux-toolkit:

- Inside the component (e.g useEffect()). The **_async-with-component_** branch. - This approach is implemented in the app.js component to handle cart data notifications.

- Inside the action creators (**_main_** branch);
