Two Approaches to execute side-effects and async tasks when dispatching actions with redux/redux-toolkit:
1 - Inside the component (e.g useEffect())

- The **_async-with-component_** branch. - This approach is implemented in the app.js component to handle cart data notifications.

2 - Inside the action creators
